            <h2>History of Lorem Ipsum</h2>
            <p>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                It has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
                unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
                Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages.

            <h2>Why is it Used?</h2>
            <p>
                Lorem Ipsum is used because it provides a normal distribution of letters,
                making it resemble readable English. This allows designers to focus on layout rather
                than the distraction of meaningful content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
                of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.

            <h3>Fun Facts About Lorem Ipsum</h3>
            <p>
                Did you know that the standard Lorem Ipsum passage, used since the 1500s, starts with
                "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit"? It originates from sections
                1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
                by Cicero.

            <h3>Modern Usage</h3>
            <p>
                Today, Lorem Ipsum is widely used by designers, developers, and content creators as a placeholder
                text to test layouts and prototypes before finalizing the content.
